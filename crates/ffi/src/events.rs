//! `uniffi::Enum`/`uniffi::Record` dictionaries over `athanor-core`'s ACP seam
//! types — never a goose type, never `serde_json::Value` across the boundary.

//! Two of these variants are **bridge-synthesized** (review edit #4): the core
//! `AcpUpdate` stream has only `TextDelta`/`ToolCall`/`TurnComplete`. The
//! bridge derives:
//! - `Condensation` from observing a `fix_salt` tool call during a turn and
//!   reading the newly-fixed realization back out of the store (see
//!   `session.rs`);
//! - `Error` from a `run_turn` that returns `Err` (never a panic across FFI).
